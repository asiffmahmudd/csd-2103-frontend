<p>In this exercise, you’ll add data validation to the application you created in exercise 1. You’ll also let the user do multiple conversions before ending the application. This is the dialog box for an invalid entry:</p>

<p>1. If you didn’t already do exercise 1, do it now.</p>
<p>2. Add data validation to the application so it won’t do the conversion until the user enters a Fahrenheit temperature between -100 and 212. If the entry is invalid, a dialog box like the one above should be displayed.</p>
<p>3. Add a loop to the code so the user can do a series of calculations without restarting the application. To end the application, the user must enter 999 as the temperature.</p>
<p>4. Comment your code.</p>
<p>5. Complete this before class on Thursday, and be prepared to show it.</p>

<h2>Use a Sales array</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you’ll start with five arrays that represent sales regions, and each array contains four values that represent the quarterly sales for the region. Then, you’ll summarize the data in these arrays in three successive alert dialog boxes.</p>
<p>The first one displays sales by quarter:</p>
<p><img src="assign02b.PNG" alt="2" title="2" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true"></p>
<p>The second one displays sales by region:</p>
<p><img src="assign02c.PNG" alt="2" title="2" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true"></p>
<p>The third one displays total sales for all four quarters and all five regions:</p>

<p>1. Open the HTML and JavaScript files in this folder:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\ch03\sales_arrays\</p>
<p>2. In the HTML file, note that the script element refers to the JavaScript file. In the JavaScript file, note that five arrays are declared with four values in each. Each of these arrays represents one sales region, and each of the values in an array represents one sales quarter. For instance, the sales for the third quarter in region 3 were 2710.</p>
<p>3. Write the code for summing the quarterly sales for each the five regions and displaying the first dialog box above.</p>
<p>4. Write the code for getting the data and displaying the second dialog box above.</p>
<p>5. Write the code for getting the data and displaying the third dialog box above.</p>
<p>6. Comment your code.</p>
<p>7. Complete this before class on Thursday, and be prepared to show it.</p></body></html>
